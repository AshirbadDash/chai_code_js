//In JavaScript, var, let, and const are keywords used to declare variables, but they differ in scope, hoisting behavior, and re-assignment rules.

//accountId = 2 //not allowed

console.table([accountEmail, accountId, accountPassword, accountCity])

//var is not used as of now because of scoping issue


//if we declare a variable and doesnot assign anything to it,it is taken as undefined.
/*
prefer let over var because issue in block scope and functional scope
